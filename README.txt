BIT-STORE BITCOIN WALLET


LIMITATIONS:
> if 2 transactions are made within ~ 5 seconds of eachother, there is a chance they will both use the same change address
> only a maximum of 100 transactions can be shown due to limits with the blockchain.info api. this may be possible to fix, but probably not worth it
